# Freer Monads, More Extensible Effects

Tim McGilchrist (@lambda_foo)

???
* Check your MTL at the door.

---
# Outline

Review of "Freer Monads, More Extensible Effects" paper.

May contain traces of Free Monads, no understanding required.

???

---
# Motivation

Acknowledge the issue being addressed, composability of Effects ie Monads.

There are 3 approaches proposed for addressing this:
  1. Monad Transformers aka transformers/MTL
  2. combine monads via a co-product
  3. effects as an interaction and having effect handlers

???
2 is Data types ala carte
3. Eff language

Extensible effects emerge as a combination of free monads and open union
2 & 3.

---
# Effects as Data

Having a look at effects as data types

``` haskell
-- Reader
data It i a = Pure a
  | Get (i -> It i a)

-- Reader/Writer
data It i o a = Pure a
  | Get (i -> It i o a)
  | Put o (() -> It i o a)
```


???
Not extensible
Data types are closed union

---
# Effects as Data cont


```haskell
instance Monad (It i o) where
  return = Pure
  Pure x >>= k = k x
  Get k' >>= k = Get (k' >>> k)
  Put u k' >>= k = Put x (k' >>> k)
```

* Not extensible
* Data types are closed union

???
Monad instance for Reader Writer

(>>>) Kleisli composition, is the composition of effectful functions

---
# Free Monad

``` haskell
data Free f a = Pure a
  | Impure (f (Free f a))


class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)
```
Pure represents no requests, while Impure are the requests.

Containing the continuation that receives the reply.

Instances of `f` define the effect signature of a particular effectful computation.
???

---
# Free Monad cont

```haskell
instance Functor f => Monad (Free r) where
  return = Pure
  Pure a >>= k = k a
  Impure f >>= k = Impure (fmap (>>= k) f)
```
???
* free monad's compose because they're based off functors which do compose.
---
# Freer Monad
```haskell
data FFree f a where
  Pure :: a -> FFree f a
  Impure :: f x -> (x -> FFree f a) -> FFree f a

```
Insight, make the `fmap` external

???
In this way we can remove the Functor constraint.

---
# Freer Monad cont

```haskell
data FReaderWriter i o x where
  Get :: FReaderWriter i o i
  Put :: o -> FReaderWriter i o ()

instance Monad (FFree f) where
  ...
  Impure fx k’ >>= k= Impure fx (k’ >>> k)

```
???
* more common pattern of accumulating continuations
* more general, it imposes less constaints than before
* Monad instance but also the Functor and Applicative instances for free.
* Direct access to the continuation means no rebuilding the mapped data like with fmap
* Can change the representation of the continuation to be more efficient. More on this later

---
# Extensible Effects

`A Monad type is extensible if we can add a new effect without having to touch or even recompile the old code.`

???

* MTL doesn't provide this. Bloody stupidly designed Monad Transformer stack
* Modeling the Effects as a data type is not extensible.


---
# Open Union

`Union (r :: * -> *) x`

The first argument r is a type level list of effect labels.
The second argument is the response type.

A concrete union has a single effect label and response type.

???

---
# Effect Isolation

Next we'd like to talk about effects in isolation, the `freer` library provides this typeclass.

``` haskell
class Member t r where
  inj :: t v -> Union r v
  prj :: Union r v -> Maybe (t v)
```
???
This allows us to assert a label `t` occurs in the list `r`.
---
# FEFree

```haskell
data FEFree r a where
  Pure :: a -> FEFree r a
  Impure :: Union r x -> (x -> FEFree r a) -> FEFree r a

data Reader i x where
  Get :: Reader i i
data Writer o x where
  Put :: o -> Writer o ()

ask :: Member (Reader i) r => Eff r i
ask = Impure (inj Get) return
```
???
Pure is fairly straight forward.

Impure takes a concrete union of a single effect and response type, a function from `x` to `FEFree r a` and gives you that.

---
# Code Examples

Switch to Emacs
???

---
# Performance Issues

The original `Free` monad while elegant had poor performance.

``` haskell
addGet ::
addGet x = ask >>= \i -> return (i + x)

(((return >>> addGet) >>> addGet) >> addGet) 0
```


???

Builds up a computation.
For n requests it takes up to n^2 time

---

# Type Aligned Lists

???

---

# Measurements

Graphs
  * Slower than State(T)
  * Performs similar to MTL on non-state examples
  * Peforms similar for deep monad stacks
???

State is a special snowflake with dedicated optimisations

---

# Conclusion

 * Removing fmap constraint
 * Represent continuations as type aligned list
 * Externalise fmap

---
# Examples
 * Catching IO Exceptions
 * LogicT, non-determinism with comitted choice
 * Monadic Regions
